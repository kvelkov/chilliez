- [ ] Zero Jupiter API errors in 24-hour test runs
- [ ] Proper handling of all Jupiter API failure modes
- [ ] Fallback opportunities show positive simulated returns
- [ ] No conflicts between Jupiter and primary DEX executions

## üîÑ Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1** (Days 1-2): Core API infrastructure and Jupiter client enhancement
2. **Phase 2** (Days 2-3): Orchestrator integration and fallback logic
3. **Phase 3** (Day 3): Error handling and safety measures
4. **Phase 4** (Days 4-5): Comprehensive testing

## üìù Notes

- Jupiter V6 API is production-ready and stable
- Existing Jupiter client needs enhancement for fallback use case
- Integration should be non-disruptive to existing DEX operations
- Fallback should be clearly distinguishable in logs and metrics
- Consider Jupiter as "last resort" - primary DEXs should remain preferred

## ‚úÖ Completion Criteria

- [ ] Jupiter fallback activates only when primary pathfinding fails
- [ ] Jupiter quotes properly validated and profitable
- [ ] Fallback transactions execute successfully in paper trading
- [ ] All error scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance impact within acceptable limits
- [ ] 48+ hours of stable operation with fallback enabled
