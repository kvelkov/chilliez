### 2025-06-18: Refactored `src/paper_trading/reporter.rs`
- Replaced all occurrences of `.get(0)` with `.first()` for idiomatic Rust.
- Reviewed function arguments for needless borrows; no unnecessary borrows found in the provided code.
- Ran `cargo check` after changes: no errors, only warnings unrelated to this file.
- See checklist in `cleanup_todo.md` for details.

### 2025-06-20: Added Default implementation for AtomicBalanceOperations in `src/monitoring/balance_monitor_enhanced.rs`
- Implemented the `Default` trait for `AtomicBalanceOperations` by delegating to `Self::new()`.
- This enables ergonomic instantiation of atomic balance operations, especially in contexts requiring a default value (e.g., struct fields, tests, or with `Default::default()`).
- This change improves code consistency and makes it easier to use atomic balance operations throughout the arbitrage bot's monitoring and reservation logic.
- Ran `cargo check` after the change: no errors, only warnings unrelated to this file.
- See checklist in `cleanup_todo.md` for details.

### 2025-06-20: Refactored clamp pattern in `src/performance/cache.rs`
- Replaced manual clamp pattern in `calculate_freshness_score` with `.clamp(0.0, 1.0)` for idiomatic Rust.
- No field assignments outside of initializers for `Default::default()` were found in this file.
- This change improves code clarity and reliability for cache freshness scoring, which is important for ensuring the arbitrage bot uses up-to-date and accurate market data.
- Ran `cargo check` after changes: no errors, only warnings unrelated to this file.
- See checklist in `cleanup_todo.md` for details.

### 2025-06-20: Added Default implementation and refactored clamp in `src/performance/metrics.rs`
- Added a `Default` implementation for `MetricsCollector`, using the correct constructors for `LatencyTracker` and `ThroughputTracker`.
- Replaced manual clamp pattern in `health_score` with idiomatic `.clamp(0.0, 1.0)`.
- These changes make metrics collection more idiomatic, robust, and easier to instantiate, improving the reliability of performance monitoring for the arbitrage bot.
- Ran `cargo check` after changes: no errors, only warnings unrelated to this file.
- See checklist in `cleanup_todo.md` for details.

### 2025-06-20: Added Default implementation for TokenMetadataCache in `src/solana/accounts.rs`
- Implemented the `Default` trait for `TokenMetadataCache`, initializing the cache as an empty, thread-safe map.
- This change allows for ergonomic and consistent instantiation of the token metadata cache, making it easier to integrate with other Solana and arbitrage bot components.
- Ran `cargo check` after changes: no errors, only warnings unrelated to this file.
- See checklist in `cleanup_todo.md` for details.

### 2025-06-20: Refactored discrepancy calculation in `src/solana/balance_monitor.rs`
- Replaced `(opt_balance as i64 - conf_balance as i64).abs() as u64` with `.unsigned_abs()` for correctness and clarity.
- No field assignments outside of initializers for `Default::default()` were found in this file.
- This change improves the safety and correctness of balance discrepancy calculations, reducing the risk of subtle bugs in balance monitoring and risk management for the arbitrage bot.
- Ran `cargo check` after changes: no errors, only warnings unrelated to this file.
- See checklist in `cleanup_todo.md` for details.

### 2025-06-20: Refactored enum and abs usage in `src/solana/event_driven_balance.rs`
- Manually boxed large enum variant fields in `BalanceEventTrigger` for memory efficiency and stack safety.
- Replaced casting result of `i64::abs()` to `u64` with `.unsigned_abs()` for correctness and clarity.
- These changes improve memory usage and correctness in event-driven balance monitoring, which is important for high-throughput and reliable arbitrage operations.
- Ran `cargo check` after changes: no errors, only warnings unrelated to this file.
- See checklist in `cleanup_todo.md` for details.

### [src/testing/mock_dex.rs] Cleanup (2025-06-20)

- Replaced static `vec!` usages for `token_mints`, `error_messages`, and `dex_configs` with array literals for efficiency and idiomatic Rust.
- Left struct fields and API-required Vecs (e.g., `route`, `accounts`, `data`, `hops`, `dex_path`, `pool_path`) as Vecs, as required by their types.
- Confirmed that `mock_dex.rs` is required for the test infrastructure (used by `mod.rs`, `stress_tests.rs`, and re-exported for test suites).
- Ran `cargo check` after changes: no errors, only warnings.
- This improves code clarity and efficiency in the mock DEX test infrastructure, supporting robust and realistic testing for the arbitrage bot.

### [src/testing/mod.rs] Cleanup (2025-06-20)

- Added a `Default` implementation for `TestSuiteRunner` by delegating to `Self::new()`. This enables ergonomic and consistent instantiation of the test suite runner, making it easier to use in tests and as a struct field.
- Ran `cargo check` after changes: no errors, only warnings.
- This improves test infrastructure ergonomics and consistency for the arbitrage bot.

### [src/arbitrage/tests.rs, src/wallet/tests.rs] Cleanup (2025-06-20)

- Removed the `mod tests` wrapper from both `src/arbitrage/tests.rs` and `src/wallet/tests.rs`, moving all code to the file scope for idiomatic Rust test organization.
- This eliminates the module inception anti-pattern (module named `tests` inside `tests.rs`) and makes test code easier to read and maintain.
- Ran `cargo check` after changes: no errors, only warnings.
- This improves test ergonomics and clarity for the arbitrage bot and wallet integration modules.

### [src/wallet/wallet_pool.rs] Cleanup (2025-06-20)

- Added a `Default` implementation for `EphemeralWallet` by delegating to `Self::new()`. This enables ergonomic and consistent instantiation of ephemeral wallets for testing and pool management.
- Replaced the manual `Default` implementation for `WalletPoolStats` with `#[derive(Default)]` for conciseness and idiomatic Rust.
- Ran `cargo check` after changes: no errors, only warnings.
- This improves ergonomics and code clarity for wallet pool management in the arbitrage bot.

### [Helius Integration Removal] (2025-06-20)

- Removed all Helius-related files: `src/helius_client.rs`, `src/webhooks/helius.rs`, `src/webhooks/helius_sdk.rs`, `src/webhooks/helius_sdk_stub.rs`, and their backups.
- Removed all code, types, and comments referencing Helius or `HeliusWebhookNotification`.
- Refactored event-driven and live update logic to use QuickNode types and flows only.
- Updated documentation and comments to reflect QuickNode-only integration.
- Validated with `cargo check` (no errors, only warnings).
