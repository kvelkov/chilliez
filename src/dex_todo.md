Based on the code structure and the recent work on pool parsers, you've laid a solid foundation. Here's a breakdown of the progress and the next steps:

I. Current Progress & Strengths:

Modular DEX Structure: You have a clear module structure (src/dex/) with individual files for different DEXs (Lifinity, Orca, Raydium, Whirlpool, Meteora, Phoenix). This is excellent for organization and scalability.
Centralized Client Initialization: src/dex/mod.rs provides get_all_clients, which is a good way to manage and access different DEX clients.
Core Utilities: src/utils/mod.rs defines key data structures like PoolInfo, PoolToken, DexType, and the PoolParser trait. The calculate_output_amount function is a helpful utility for standard AMMs.
Initial Pool Parsing Logic: Draft implementations for PoolParser for Lifinity, Orca, Raydium, and Whirlpool are in place (as per our previous discussion). These aim to fetch token mints, decimals, and reserves.
Configuration & Caching: Integration of Cache and Config into client initialization shows foresight for performance and adaptability.
Asynchronous Operations: The use of async/await and async_trait is appropriate for I/O-bound operations like RPC calls.

 ### Task 1.2: Validate and Refine On-Chain State Structs
-- [ ] **Review `LifinityPoolState`:** Ensure accuracy against Lifinity's on-chain data layout.
-- [ ] **Review `OrcaPoolState` (for non-Whirlpool Orca pools):** Ensure accuracy. Consider different Orca pool versions.
-- [ ] **Review `RaydiumAmmState`:** Ensure accuracy. Consider different Raydium AMM versions.
-- [ ] **Review `WhirlpoolState`:** Ensure accuracy. **Strongly consider using `orca_sdk::state::Whirlpool` if possible.**
-- [ ] **General:** For all manually defined state structs, double-check field layouts, types, discriminators, and padding. Prioritize using official SDK structs where available.

+- [ ] **General (for manually defined structs):** Double-check field layouts, types, discriminators, and padding.
+- [ ] **Anchor-based Programs Note:** For Anchor-based programs, primarily use `anchor-lang::AccountDeserialize` for state parsing. Instruction building will be handled by specific DEX SDKs (like `orca_whirlpools_client`) or manually for maximum control and minimal overhead, unless `anchor-client` proves significantly beneficial for a particular non-DEX Anchor integration.
