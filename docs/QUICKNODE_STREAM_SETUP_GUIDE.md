# QuickNode Stream Setup Guide
# Complete step-by-step guide to set up real-time streams for arbitrage detection

## ðŸŽ¯ What Are QuickNode Streams?

QuickNode Streams are real-time WebSocket connections that notify you instantly when:
- Transactions occur on specific programs (like DEXs)
- Account balances change
- New blocks are produced
- Specific events happen on-chain

Think of it like getting a phone notification every time someone makes a trade on Orca or Raydium!

## ðŸ“‹ Step 1: Understanding Stream Types

### Account Streams
Monitor when specific accounts (like pool addresses) change:
```json
{
  "method": "accountSubscribe", 
  "params": ["POOL_ADDRESS_HERE"]
}
```

### Program Log Streams  
Monitor all transactions that interact with a specific program:
```json
{
  "method": "logsSubscribe",
  "params": [{"mentions": ["DEX_PROGRAM_ID_HERE"]}]
}
```

### Signature Streams
Monitor specific transactions by their signature:
```json
{
  "method": "signatureSubscribe",
  "params": ["TRANSACTION_SIGNATURE_HERE"]
}
```
