# üöÄ 2024-06-24 ‚Üí 2025-05-14: Major Refactor Plan for Cross-DEX, Multi-Hop Arbitrage

## üü¢ Architectural Direction & Workflow (APPROVED)
- **Modular, testable, and future-proof architecture** for robust cross-DEX, multi-hop arbitrage.
- **Key modules:**
  - `detector.rs`: Opportunity detection (now multi-hop, cross-DEX aware)
  - `calculator.rs`: Analytics, profit/slippage/risk/rebate logic (multi-hop aware)
  - `engine.rs`: State management, live updates, orchestration
  - `executor.rs`: Execution of arbitrage paths (atomic, multi-leg)
- **All analytics, detection, and execution logic must be modular and testable.**
- **All major architectural/code changes must be documented and approved here before implementation.**

## üìù Action Plan & Progress Log

### 1. Design & Planning
- [x] Review current project structure, code, and README for architectural clarity and limitations.
- [x] Confirm analytics functions in `calculator.rs` are actively used in detection pipeline.
- [x] Draft new modular architecture and workflow (see above).
- [x] Confirm current arbitrage model is insufficient for cross-DEX, multi-hop; new model needed.
- [x] Draft this action plan and progress log.

### 2. Core Refactor Steps
- [x] **Design new arbitrage opportunity struct and pipeline** to support multi-hop, cross-DEX routes (`src/arbitrage/opportunity.rs`).
- [x] **Integrate and extend existing WebSocket and Solana RPC/account modules** for multi-hop arbitrage state management and detection (reuse, don't rebuild).
- [x] **Refactor `detector.rs`** to find and represent multi-hop, cross-DEX opportunities using the new struct.
- [x] **Refactor `calculator.rs`** to support multi-hop profit, slippage, risk, and rebate calculations.
- [x] **Remove legacy blacklist/tempban logic**: migrated all ban logic to CSV-based functions in `detector.rs` and deleted `pair_blacklist.rs`/`pair_tempban.rs`.
- [x] **Update all detection and execution logic** to use new CSV-based ban functions.
- [x] **Update TODO.md** with detailed progress and next steps.
- [ ] **Refactor `engine.rs` and `executor.rs`** for state management and execution of complex arbitrage paths.
- [ ] **Add/expand tests** for new models and logic.
- [ ] **Clean up warnings and dead code** after refactor.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Reusable Infrastructure
- WebSocket subscription, reconnection, and event channel logic (`solana/websocket.rs`, `websocket/`)
- High-availability Solana RPC client (`solana/rpc.rs`)
- Token/account parsing and metadata caching (`solana/accounts.rs`)

### 3. Documentation & Tracking
- [x] **Keep this TODO.md updated** with progress, decisions, and architectural changes.
- [ ] **Update README.md** with new architecture, workflow, and progress.

- ‚úÖ **Canonical Imports for Cleaner Code:** Use standard function calls and remove redundant methods/dependencies.
- ‚úÖ **Dead Code Cleanup:** Prune suppressions and unused code to streamline compilation and reduce lint warnings.
- ‚úÖ **Simulated Swaps:** Perform virtual transactions before executing real ones for accuracy.
- ‚úÖ **Price Discrepancy Thresholds:** Set dynamic trade limits to avoid unnecessary trades.

- ‚úÖ **Multi-TX Atomic Execution:** Bundle arbitrage legs into a single transaction.
- ‚úÖ **DEX Liquidity Mirroring:** Mirror real-time order books in memory for fast decisions.
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Fee-Based Routing:** Reroute trades to cheaper DEXs when network fees spike.
- ‚úÖ **Parallel Price Discovery:** Use Tokio tasks for concurrent DEX pool updates.
- ‚úÖ **Adaptive WebSocket Scaling:** Dynamically adjust subscription intensity by volatility.
- ‚úÖ **Profitability Trends per DEX:** Track historical trade success for pattern discovery.

- ‚úÖ **Reinforcement Learning Trade Optimization:** Self-improving trade logic.
- ‚úÖ **Auto-Liquidity Prediction:** Predict liquidity spikes using historical AI models.
- ‚úÖ **Adaptive Strategy Switching:** Auto-switch between market-making, arbitrage, and passive strategies.

# 2025-05-14: Progress Update & Next Steps

## ‚úÖ Completed
- Multi-hop detection pipeline implemented and integrated into engine and main.rs (`detector.rs` multi-hop refactor complete).
- Existing WebSocket, Solana RPC, and account modules are reused for state management and detection.
- All ban/blacklist logic unified in `detector.rs` with CSV logging.
- Legacy ban files (`pair_blacklist.rs`, `pair_tempban.rs`) removed.
- All detection and execution logic now uses new CSV-based ban functions.
- Project builds cleanly; only dead code warnings remain.
- TODO.md and documentation updated to reflect new architecture and progress.

## üü° Next Steps
- [ ] Refactor `engine.rs` and `executor.rs` for robust multi-hop execution and logging:
    - Accept `MultiHopArbOpportunity` and iterate over hops, building DEX-specific instructions for each.
    - Add clear logging for "happy journey" (success) and "sad journey" (failure/miss).
    - Ensure robust error handling and logging for each hop.
- [ ] Expand/refactor tests for new ban logic and multi-hop analytics.
