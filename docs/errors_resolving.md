# Error Resolution Log

## 1. `tests.rs` Errors

- [x] **Error: `cannot find struct, variant or union type ArbHop in this scope`**
  - Solution: Added `use crate::arbitrage::ArbHop;` at the top of `tests.rs`. Confirmed that `ArbHop` is re-exported in `arbitrage/mod.rs` and the import is now present. (Note: Now only triggers an unused import warning, not an error.)

- [ ] **Error: `cannot find struct, variant or union type OrchestratorDeps in this scope`**
  - Solution: Pending. Need to ensure `use crate::arbitrage::orchestrator::core::OrchestratorDeps;` is present in `tests.rs` and that the type is defined and public.

- [x] **Error: `no function or associated item named new found for struct analysis::math::XYKSlippageModel in the current scope`**
  - Solution: Replaced `XYKSlippageModel::new()` with `XYKSlippageModel {}` in `src/arbitrage/tests.rs` since the struct is zero-sized and does not require a constructor.

## 2. `jupiter_fallback.rs` Errors

- [x] **Error: `no field price_aggregator on type ArbitrageOrchestrator`**
  - Solution: Refactored the test to use the public API (`get_aggregated_quote`) instead of checking for a field. Removed all direct field access to `price_aggregator` in `tests/jupiter_fallback.rs`.

## 3. Other Compile Warnings/Errors

- [ ] **Warning: unused import: `Duration` in `src/arbitrage/analysis/math.rs`**
  - Solution: Pending. Remove the unused import to resolve the warning.

- [ ] **Error: no function or associated item named `default` found for struct `BannedPairsManager` in `src/main.rs`**
  - Solution: Pending. Replace `BannedPairsManager::default()` with `BannedPairsManager::new(<csv_path>).unwrap()` as per the struct's API.
