# QuickNode/Axum Integration & Legacy Webhook Cleanup Log

**Date:** 2025-06-18

## Summary
This document tracks all codebase changes made to fully migrate from Helius/legacy webhook logic to the new QuickNode + Axum-based webhook integration for the Solana arbitrage bot. All legacy types, endpoints, and logic have been removed or refactored, and only QuickNode/Axum logic remains.

---

## Major Changes

### 1. Removed Helius/Legacy Webhook Code
- Deleted all references to HeliusWebhookManager, WebhookServer, EnhancedWebhookServer, WebhookServerStats, EnhancedTransaction, and related types.
- Removed all Helius-specific endpoints, structs, and logic from `src/webhooks/server.rs`, `src/webhooks/processor.rs`, and `src/webhooks/integration.rs`.
- Cleaned up all `pub use` exports for legacy webhook types in `src/webhooks/mod.rs`.

### 2. QuickNode/Axum Integration
- Only QuickNode/Axum webhook server logic remains in `src/webhooks/server.rs`.
- All webhook authentication and processing now uses QuickNode payloads and types.
- `PoolUpdateProcessor` now only processes QuickNode opportunities.

### 3. Refactored Integration Logic
- Removed all references to legacy methods: `add_update_callback`, `get_stats`, `process_notification`, `update_pool_cache`.
- Removed all references to `webhook_manager` fields, parameters, and assignments in all affected files.
- Updated orchestrator construction to match new QuickNode integration signatures.
- Removed or annotated unused variables as needed.

### 4. Outstanding Issues
- Some orchestrator and FFI code may still need minor refactoring for argument/lifetime issues.
- All legacy webhook code is now removed; only QuickNode logic remains.

---

## Next Steps
- Continue to test and validate the QuickNode/Axum integration end-to-end.
- Refactor orchestrator/FFI code for any remaining argument or lifetime issues.
- Keep this document updated with any further integration or cleanup changes.
