  - [x] Fix misplaced/duplicate function definitions and imports

### NOTE: OrcaClient trait methods are currently stubbed with `todo!()` for compilation. To complete these:
- Implement `calculate_onchain_quote`, `get_swap_instruction`, `get_swap_instruction_enhanced`, `discover_pools`, and `health_check` in the `DexClient` impl.
- Implement `fetch_pool_data`, `discover_pools`, `dex_name`, and `as_any` in the `PoolDiscoverable` impl.
- Remove or update the `todo!()` macros with real logic and ensure all trait requirements are met for full functionality.
- Review and test all trait methods for correct integration with the rest of the codebase.

## src/dex/discovery.rs

- [x] **tests.rs**
  - [x] Refactor module inception (module named `tests` inside `tests.rs`)

#### Findings & Changes:
- Removed the `mod tests` wrapper from both `src/arbitrage/tests.rs` and `src/wallet/tests.rs`, moving all code to the file scope for idiomatic Rust test organization.

- [x] **mev_protection.rs**
  - [x] Replace useless use of `vec!` for static arrays

#### Findings & Changes:
- Reviewed all static `vec![]` usages in `mev_protection.rs`. All instances are required to be `Vec` due to mutation or API requirements, so no further static array conversions were possible without breaking the code.
- No runtime behavior changes; this cleanup ensures the code is as idiomatic as possible without breaking API contracts. Maintains clarity and correctness for future maintainers and contributors.
- Validated with `cargo check` (no errors, only warnings).

### 2025-06-20: Next Cleanup/Optimization TODOs

1. **Address All Outstanding Clippy Warnings:**
   - [x] Refactor all "unnecessary let binding" returns to return the expression directly (e.g., in `src/arbitrage/strategy.rs`).
     - Refactored two instances in `src/arbitrage/strategy.rs` where a `let` binding was immediately returned. Now the expressions are returned directly, as recommended by clippy.
     - **Expected result:** More idiomatic and concise Rust code, no change in logic or behavior. This reduces unnecessary variable assignments and improves code clarity.
   - [x] Replace all single-pattern `match` statements with `if let` where appropriate (e.g., in `src/dex/clients/jupiter.rs`, `src/dex/clients/orca.rs`).
     - Refactored single-pattern match statements to `if let` in `record_api_success` (`src/dex/clients/jupiter.rs`) and `extract_orca_whirlpool_addresses_from_json` (`src/dex/clients/orca.rs`).
     - **Expected result:** More idiomatic and concise Rust code, less boilerplate, and improved clarity. No change in logic or behavior. Build validated with `cargo check` (no errors, only warnings).
   - [x] Remove all useless conversions (e.g., `map_err(anyhow::Error::from)` where the type is already `anyhow::Error`).
     - Removed all unnecessary conversions to `anyhow::Error` in `src/dex/clients/lifinity.rs` by using the `?` operator directly on the results.
     - **Expected result:** More idiomatic and concise Rust code, no change in logic or error handling. Build validated with `cargo check` (no errors, only warnings).
   - [x] Replace all useless `format!` usages with `.to_string()` (e.g., pool names in DEX clients).
     - Confirmed all pool name and symbol assignments in DEX clients use `.to_string()` and not `format!`. No useless `format!` usages remain in these assignments.
     - **Expected result:** No unnecessary heap allocations or formatting for static strings. Code is already idiomatic and efficient. Build validated with `cargo check` (no errors, only warnings).
   - [ ] Remove unnecessary reference patterns in `match` arms (e.g., `match &pattern` → `match pattern`).
   - [ ] Refactor all manual range checks to use `.contains()` or `!(range).contains(&val)` idioms.
   - [ ] Replace all manual clamp patterns with `.clamp()` idioms.
   - [ ] Replace all manual assign-op patterns (e.g., `a = a * b`) with `a *= b` or `a /= b`.
   - [ ] Remove all unnecessary borrows in function calls (e.g., `&["a", "b"]` → `["a", "b"]`).
   - [ ] Add missing `Default` implementations for all client and utility structs flagged by clippy.

2. **Optimize and Refactor DEX Client Modules:**
   - Review all DEX client modules (`lifinity.rs`, `orca.rs`, `meteora.rs`, `raydium.rs`, `phoenix.rs`) for:
     - Dead/unused code, functions, and fields.
     - Redundant or duplicate logic.
     - Opportunities to consolidate similar code paths (e.g., pool construction, error handling).
     - Consistent and idiomatic error handling.
   - Remove or refactor as needed.

3. **Review and Optimize Math/Discovery Modules:**
   - Refactor all math utility functions for idiomatic Rust and performance.
   - Remove any unused math helpers or constants.
   - Ensure all discovery logic is up-to-date and not duplicating DEX client logic.

4. **Test Infrastructure Cleanup:**
   - Remove obsolete or redundant test files, mocks, and helpers.
   - Ensure all test modules are idiomatic and only contain necessary tests.
   - Confirm all test helpers are used; remove any that are not.

5. **Configuration and Secrets:**
   - Ensure all configuration, secrets, and endpoints are loaded securely from environment variables or config files.
   - Remove any hardcoded secrets, endpoints, or test keys from the codebase.

6. **Documentation and Comments:**
   - Update documentation and inline comments to reflect all recent changes (especially QuickNode/webhook logic).
   - Remove outdated or misleading comments.
   - Ensure all public functions and modules have clear, concise doc comments.

7. **Final Production Readiness Review:**
   - Audit for robust error handling, logging, and monitoring.
   - Ensure all panics are handled or converted to recoverable errors.
   - Confirm all critical paths are covered by tests.
