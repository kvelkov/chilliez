- **Automated optimization** based on performance metrics

## 🛠️ Usage Examples

### Basic Integration
```rust
let performance_config = PerformanceConfig::default();
let performance_manager = Arc::new(PerformanceManager::new(performance_config).await?);
let smart_router = SmartRouter::new(config, graph, fee_estimator).await?;
```

### Parallel Processing
```rust
let executor = performance_manager.parallel_executor();
let results = executor.execute_concurrent(quote_tasks).await;
```

### Caching
```rust
let cache_manager = performance_manager.cache_manager();
cache_manager.set_pool_state(pool_address, pool_state).await;
let cached_state = cache_manager.get_pool_state(&pool_address).await;
```

### Monitoring
```rust
let metrics = performance_manager.metrics_collector();
let report = performance_manager.get_performance_report().await;
```

## 🎯 Production Readiness

The performance optimization system is now production-ready with:
- ✅ **Type Safety** - All types properly defined and exported
