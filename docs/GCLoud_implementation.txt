Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and configured:

Google Cloud SDK: Install and initialize the gcloud CLI.
Docker: Install Docker on your local machine to build container images.
kubectl: The Kubernetes command-line tool. You can install it via gcloud components install kubectl.
A Google Cloud Project: Create a new project in the Google Cloud Console.
Step 1: Containerize Your Rust Application
The first step is to package your Rust bot into a Docker container. This makes it portable and easy to deploy.

Create a Dockerfile in the root of your project (kvelkov/chilliez/chilliez-39e9e0cb0a2695f241c150cfe12ba5019fee334e/). This file will define how to build your Rust application.

Dockerfile

# Use the official Rust image as a builder
FROM rust:1.78 as builder

# Create a new empty shell project
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY . .

# Build the application
# This will cache dependencies
RUN cargo build --release

# Create a new, smaller image for the final container
FROM debian:buster-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y openssl libssl-dev ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy the built binary from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app/target/release/solana-arb-bot /usr/local/bin/solana-arb-bot

# Set the entrypoint
CMD ["solana-arb-bot"]
Create a .dockerignore file in the same directory to exclude unnecessary files from the container, which will speed up the build process.

.git
.gitignore
target/
.vscode/
Step 2: Push the Docker Image to Google Artifact Registry
Store your container image in Google Artifact Registry, a private and secure Docker registry.

Enable the Artifact Registry API:

Bash

gcloud services enable artifactregistry.googleapis.com
Create a Docker repository:

Bash

gcloud artifacts repositories create arbitrage-bots \
    --repository-format=docker \
    --location=us-west1 \
    --description="Docker repository for arbitrage bots"
Configure Docker to authenticate with Artifact Registry:

Bash

gcloud auth configure-docker us-west1-docker.pkg.dev
Build and push the image:
Replace [PROJECT-ID] with your Google Cloud project ID.

Bash

# Build the Docker image
docker build . -t us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/[PROJECT-ID]/arbitrage-bots/solana-arb-bot:latest

# Push the image to Artifact Registry
docker push us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/[PROJECT-ID]/arbitrage-bots/solana-arb-bot:latest
Step 3: Set Up Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
GKE provides a managed Kubernetes environment to run your containerized application.

Create a GKE cluster:
A regional cluster in us-west1 is a good choice for low latency to Solana validators.

Bash

gcloud container clusters create arbitrage-cluster \
    --region us-west1 \
    --num-nodes=1 \
    --machine-type=e2-high-cpu-2 \
    --enable-autoscaling --min-nodes=1 --max-nodes=3
Configure kubectl to connect to your new cluster:

Bash

gcloud container clusters get-credentials arbitrage-cluster --region us-west1
Step 4: Deploy the Bot to GKE
Deploy your bot using Kubernetes manifest files.

Create bot-deployment.yaml: This file describes how to run your bot's container.

YAML

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: solana-arb-bot
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: solana-arb-bot
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: solana-arb-bot
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: bot-container
        image: us-west1-docker.pkg.dev/[PROJECT-ID]/arbitrage-bots/solana-arb-bot:latest
        # Add environment variables for configuration
        env:
        - name: RUST_LOG
          value: "info"
        # Add more configuration from your Cargo.toml and other files here
        # For secrets, use Kubernetes Secrets (see Step 8)
Apply the deployment:

Bash

kubectl apply -f bot-deployment.yaml
Verify the deployment:

Bash

kubectl get pods
You should see a pod with a name like solana-arb-bot-... in the Running state.

Step 5: Set Up Vertex AI for ML Tasks
For your Python scripts (app.py, check_mps.py), Vertex AI provides a managed environment for ML development and execution.

Enable the Vertex AI API:

Bash

gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com
Create a Vertex AI Notebook:

Go to the Vertex AI section in the Google Cloud Console.
Navigate to Workbench > Managed Notebooks.
Click New Notebook and configure it with a suitable machine type (e.g., n1-standard-4) and a GPU if needed.
Choose a Python 3 environment.
Clone your repository into the notebook and run your scripts. This will provide a powerful, managed environment for your AI tasks.

Step 6: Configure Monitoring and Logging
Leverage Google Cloud's Operations Suite for powerful monitoring and logging.

Logging: GKE automatically integrates with Cloud Logging. You can view your bot's logs by navigating to Logging > Logs Explorer in the Cloud Console and filtering by your GKE cluster and pod name.
Monitoring: Your prometheus.yml and metrics-exporter-statsd can be integrated with Cloud Monitoring.
Set up a Prometheus instance in your cluster to scrape metrics.
Use the Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus to ingest these metrics into Cloud Monitoring without managing a full Prometheus server.
Create Dashboards in Cloud Monitoring to visualize metrics like trade volume, profit, and latency.
Set up Alerting to be notified of critical events.
Step 7: Set up Notifications with Pub/Sub
Use Pub/Sub for a reliable and scalable notification system.

Create a Pub/Sub topic:

Bash

gcloud pubsub topics create trade-notifications
Modify your Rust bot to publish messages to this topic whenever a significant event occurs (e.g., a profitable trade). You will need to use the google-cloud-pubsub crate.

Create a Cloud Function to subscribe to the topic and send a notification (e.g., via email or a messaging app).

Go to Cloud Functions in the Cloud Console.
Click Create Function.
Set the trigger to Cloud Pub/Sub and select the trade-notifications topic.
Write a simple function (e.g., in Python) to process the message and send a notification.
Step 8: Manage Configuration and Secrets
Never hardcode secrets in your container images. Use Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data.

Create a Kubernetes Secret for your API keys and wallet information:

Bash

kubectl create secret generic bot-secrets \
    --from-literal=GOOGLE_API_KEY='your-google-api-key' \
    --from-file=wallet.json='/path/to/your/wallet.json'
Mount the secret in your bot-deployment.yaml:

YAML

# ... inside the container spec
envFrom:
- secretRef:
    name: bot-secrets
This will make the secrets available as environment variables inside your container.

This setup provides a robust, scalable, and manageable infrastructure for your arbitrage bot, allowing you to focus on developing and improving your trading strategies.
