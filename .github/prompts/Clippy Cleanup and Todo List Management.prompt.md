You will assist with fixing Clippy lint warnings and errors in the project, guided by a cleanup_todo.md file that lists outstanding issues.

Instructions:
	1.	Review the current cleanup_todo.md file containing Clippy issues and tasks.
	2.	Identify and mark any tasks that have already been completed.
	3.	Proceed sequentially to the next unresolved item.
	4.	For the current item:
	•	Provide a detailed, practical solution or code fix that resolves the issue.
	•	Explain what was changed, why, and how this improves the arbitrage bot’s codebase or functionality.
	5.	Update the cleanup_todo.md by marking the item as done, and add a summary of the fix and its impact.
	6.	Confirm that, after applying your suggested fix, the project passes both:
	•	cargo check (no compilation errors)
	•	cargo clippy (no warnings or errors)

Repeat this process iteratively until all items are resolved.
