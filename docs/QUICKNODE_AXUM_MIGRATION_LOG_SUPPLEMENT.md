# 2025-06-18: QuickNode/Axum Migration & Event-Driven Balance Monitoring Reactivation (Supplement)

## Summary of Actions

### 1. Re-enabled Event-Driven Balance Monitoring
- Restored the callback/observer pattern in `PoolUpdateProcessor`.
- Implemented `add_update_callback` and `notify_callbacks` methods.
- Updated `process_quicknode_opportunity` to notify registered callbacks with a stubbed `PoolUpdateEvent` (mapping from QuickNode tx to event should be improved).
- Updated `EventDrivenBalanceMonitor::register_with_webhook_processor` to use the callback system for real-time balance triggers.

### 2. Confirmed Removal of Unused QuickNode JS Files
- Marked for removal:
  - `src/functions/quicknode_arbitrage_function.js`
  - `src/streams/quicknode_arbitrage_filter.js`
- Removed `src/ffi.rs` and `test_arbitrage_ffi.js` as part of final QuickNode/Axum migration cleanup.
- All FFI and JS bridge logic is now deprecated and not referenced in the orchestrator or update pipeline.

---

## Next Steps
- Improve mapping from QuickNode arbitrage transactions to `PoolUpdateEvent` for richer event-driven monitoring.
- Remove the two unused JS files from the repository.
- Continue to test and validate event-driven balance monitoring with QuickNode data.
