//! Lifinity DEX integration with proactive market making support.
//!
//! This module provides the necessary traits and structs to interact with the
//! Lifinity decentralized exchange, enabling the creation and management of
//! liquidity pools, as well as the execution of trades with proactive market
//! making strategies.
//!
//! The implementation is based on the Lifinity protocol specifications and
//! is designed to be used in conjunction with the `clients` module for
//! seamless integration with the rest of the application.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The Lifinity DEX integration consists of the following main components:
//!
//! - `LifinityClient`: A client for interacting with the Lifinity DEX,
//!    providing methods for trade execution and liquidity management.
//! - `LifinityPool`: A struct representing a liquidity pool on the Lifinity DEX,
//!    containing information about the pool's assets, liquidity, and fees.
//! - `MarketMaker`: A trait defining the behavior of a proactive market maker,
//!    with methods for calculating optimal trade parameters and managing
//!    liquidity positions.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! To use the Lifinity DEX integration, you need to create an instance of
//! `LifinityClient`, configure it with your preferred settings, and use it to
//! interact with the DEX. You can create and manage liquidity pools using the
//! `LifinityPool` struct, and implement custom market making strategies by
//! implementing the `MarketMaker` trait.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use crate::clients::lifinity::{LifinityClient, LifinityPool, MarketMaker};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // Create a new Lifinity client
//!     let client = LifinityClient::new(...);
//!
//!     // Create a new liquidity pool
//!     let pool = LifinityPool::new(...);
//!
//!     // Implement a custom market making strategy
//!     struct MyMarketMaker;
//!
//!     impl MarketMaker for MyMarketMaker {
//!         // Implement the required methods...
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! For more detailed information on each component and how to use them,
//! please refer to the individual module documentation and the Lifinity
//! protocol specifications.
//!
//! --- Lifinity Math Implementation ---
//! Lifinity-specific mathematical calculations with proactive market making.
//!
//! This module provides the mathematical foundations for the Lifinity DEX
//! integration, including functions for calculating optimal trade parameters,
//! slippage, and other key metrics for proactive market making.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The Lifinity math implementation includes the following main components:
//!
//! - `calculate_optimal_trade`: A function for calculating the optimal trade
//!    size and direction based on the current market conditions, liquidity
//!    parameters, and the trader's desired risk profile.
//! - `calculate_slippage`: A function for estimating the slippage impact of
//!    a given trade size on the market, helping traders to minimize
//!    slippage losses.
//! - `calculate_liquidity`: A function for determining the optimal liquidity
//!    provision for a given trading strategy, taking into account the
//!    expected trade volume, volatility, and other factors.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! To use the Lifinity math implementation, simply import the desired
//! functions into your module and call them with the appropriate parameters.
//! For example, to calculate the optimal trade size, you would use the
//! `calculate_optimal_trade` function as follows:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use crate::math::lifinity::calculate_optimal_trade;
//!
//! fn example_trade_strategy(...) {
//!     // Calculate the optimal trade size
//!     let (trade_size, direction) = calculate_optimal_trade(...);
//!
//!     // Execute the trade using the calculated parameters
//!     ...
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! For more detailed information on each function and how to use them,
//! please refer to the individual function documentation and the Lifinity
//! protocol specifications.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use crate::math::lifinity::{calculate_optimal_trade, calculate_slippage};
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // Calculate the optimal trade size and direction
//!     let (trade_size, direction) = calculate_optimal_trade(...);
//!
//!     // Estimate the slippage impact of the trade
//!     let slippage = calculate_slippage(trade_size, ...);
//!
//!     // Execute the trade with the calculated parameters
//!     ...
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! For more detailed information on each function and how to use them,
//! please refer to the individual function documentation and the Lifinity
//! protocol specifications.
