//! Arbitrage Orchestrator Refactoring Plan
//! 
//! The current orchestrator.rs file (1540+ lines) needs to be split into smaller,
//! focused modules for better maintainability, testability, and clarity.

/*
CURRENT STRUCTURE PROBLEMS:
- Single massive file with mixed responsibilities
- Hard to test individual components
- Difficult to maintain and understand
- Violation of Single Responsibility Principle

PROPOSED MODULAR STRUCTURE:
```
src/arbitrage/orchestrator/
├── mod.rs                    (Main orchestrator interface - 100-150 lines)
├── core.rs                   (Core orchestrator struct and basic methods)
├── detection_engine.rs       (Opportunity detection logic)
├── execution_manager.rs      (Execution coordination and strategy)
├── concurrency_manager.rs    (Thread safety and concurrent execution)
├── monitoring_manager.rs     (Balance monitoring and health checks)
├── lifecycle_manager.rs      (Start/stop, health checks, recovery)
├── metrics_collector.rs      (Performance metrics and reporting)
└── config_manager.rs         (Configuration management and validation)
```

BENEFITS:
✅ Each file has a single responsibility
✅ Easier to test individual components
✅ Better code organization and readability
✅ Reduced compilation times for changes
✅ Easier to onboard new developers
✅ Cleaner separation of concerns

// Implementation Plan
// =============================================================================

/*
PHASE 1: Create Module Structure
1. Create orchestrator/ directory
2. Move core struct definition to core.rs
3. Create mod.rs with public interface

PHASE 2: Extract Detection Logic
1. Move opportunity detection to detection_engine.rs
2. Move hot cache logic to detection_engine.rs
3. Update imports and references

PHASE 3: Extract Execution Logic
1. Move execution methods to execution_manager.rs
2. Move strategy selection to execution_manager.rs
3. Update method calls

PHASE 4: Extract Concurrency Logic
1. Move thread-safe execution to concurrency_manager.rs
2. Move deadlock prevention to concurrency_manager.rs
3. Update synchronization

PHASE 5: Extract Monitoring Logic
1. Move balance monitoring to monitoring_manager.rs
2. Move health checks to lifecycle_manager.rs
3. Update monitoring calls

PHASE 6: Extract Supporting Components
1. Move metrics to metrics_collector.rs
2. Move configuration to config_manager.rs
3. Final cleanup and testing
