# Jupiter DEX Aggregator Integration TODO

A step-by-step actionable checklist for integrating the Jupiter DEX aggregator as a supported DEX client in the Solana arbitrage bot. Check off each item as you complete it.

## Jupiter Integration Checklist

- [x] 1. Review existing Jupiter client implementation in `src/dex/clients/jupiter.rs`.
- [x] 2. Enable Jupiter client in `src/dex/clients/mod.rs` (uncomment and export `JupiterClient`).
- [x] 3. Add `JupiterClient` to the DEX client vector in `src/dex/mod.rs`.
- [x] 4. Update DEX client tests in `src/dex/dex_tests.rs` to expect Jupiter as a supported client.
- [x] 5. Run `cargo check` and `cargo test` to ensure all code compiles and tests pass.
- [x] 6. Review and document the Jupiter API endpoints and parameters used in `jupiter.rs` (see `docs/jupiter_reame.txt`).
- [x] 7. Add/expand Jupiter-specific error handling and logging for API failures or edge cases.
- [x] 8. Add/expand integration tests for Jupiter client (mock API responses if needed).
- [x] 9. Validate Jupiter integration with real or simulated trade data (end-to-end test).
- [x] 10. Update documentation to reflect Jupiter support (README, code comments, etc.).
- [x] 11. Review for production readiness: rate limits, retries, security, and monitoring.
    - [x] Add retry logic for transient network errors (timeouts, 5xx) with exponential backoff for GET requests.
    - [x] Add circuit breaker to avoid hammering the API during outages.
    - [x] Add metrics for monitoring request success/failure rates.
    - [x] Add metrics for request latency, error types, and in-flight requests.
    - [x] Security: No sensitive data is handled; all requests are public API calls.
- [ ] 12. (Optional) Add configuration options to enable/disable Jupiter at runtime.
- [ ] Switch to metrics-exporter-log for metrics logging
- [ ] Add metrics-exporter-log to Cargo.toml
- [ ] Initialize metrics_exporter_log::init() in main.rs
- [ ] Re-enable metrics macros (counter!, gauge!, histogram!) in code
- [ ] Document metrics logging in docs/METRICS_LOGGING.md
- [ ] Remove Prometheus-specific setup from code and docs
