DEX IMPLEMENTATION
Option 1: Unified Solana SDK version + direct CPI or RPC integration
Best (cleanest + most stable)

You unify everything around one version of the Solana SDK (e.g., v1.17.29), and build adapters that interact with each pool using:

Low-level on-chain instructions (CPI) via solana-program crate

OR

JSON-RPC calls (e.g., getProgramAccounts, simulateTransaction)

Advantages:

üîí No dependency rot from random GitHub crates

üîß Fully under your control (you build interaction logic)

üß™ Maximum compatibility, since you‚Äôre not importing every pool‚Äôs Rust client

‚ú® Better for long-term upgrades & CI

Disadvantages:

‚è± Initial dev time is higher (you must write instruction encoders & parsers)

üìÑ You need to understand each protocol‚Äôs on-chain interface

üì¶ Crates used: Only solana-client, solana-program, solana-transaction-status, and solana-sdk ‚Äî one version across all.

DEX Client Research & Integration Details
This section contains the specific details required to build adapters for each target DEX.

1. Orca (Whirlpools)
Orca's modern pools are "Whirlpools" (concentrated liquidity). Integration should focus exclusively on these for capital efficiency.

Official Docs: Orca Developer Docs

Reference SDK: Orca Whirlpools SDK (TypeScript) - Use this as the primary reference.

Technical Deep Dive: Whirlpools 101

Program ID: whirLbMiicVdio4qvUfM5KAg6Ct8VwpYzGff3uctyCc

Key Accounts:

Whirlpool: The main pool state account.

Token Vaults (A and B): SPL Token accounts holding reserves.

TickArray: Stores discrete price points ("ticks"). A swap must provide the pubkeys of relevant TickArray accounts for the price range being crossed.

Oracle: PDA providing time-weighted average prices (TWAP).

Relevant Instruction: swap. Requires user token accounts, pool vaults, Whirlpool account, and the correct TickArray accounts. The main challenge is determining which TickArray accounts are needed for a given swap size, which requires off-chain simulation.

Rust Scaffolding (Whirlpool struct):

use bytemuck::{Pod, Zeroable};
use solana_sdk::pubkey::Pubkey;

#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, Pod, Zeroable)]
pub struct Whirlpool {
    pub whirlpools_config: Pubkey,
    pub whirlpool_bump: [u8; 1],
    pub tick_spacing: u16,
    pub tick_spacing_padding: [u8; 5],
    pub fee_rate: u16,
    pub protocol_fee_rate: u16,
    pub liquidity: u128,
    pub sqrt_price: u128,
    pub tick_current_index: i32,
    pub protocol_fee_owed_a: u64,
    pub protocol_fee_owed_b: u64,
    pub token_mint_a: Pubkey,
    pub token_vault_a: Pubkey,
    pub fee_growth_global_a: u128,
    pub token_mint_b: Pubkey,
    pub token_vault_b: Pubkey,
    pub fee_growth_global_b: u128,
    pub reward_last_updated_timestamp: u64,
    // ... followed by reward_infos array
}

2. Raydium (AMM V4)
Focus on the standard AMM pools (V4) for stability. CLMM pools are a future target.

Official Docs: Raydium Developer Docs

Reference SDK: Raydium SDK (TypeScript)

Program ID (AMM V4): 675kPX9MHTjS2zt1qfr1NYHuzeLXfQM9H24wFSUt1Mp8

Key Accounts:

Amm Pool Account: Main state account.

Amm Authority: PDA for pool vaults.

Token Vaults (Base & Quote): SPL Token accounts for reserves.

LP Mint: Mint for LP tokens.

OpenOrders & TargetOrders: Serum-related accounts.

Serum Market: Crucial dependency. The parser must fetch and parse this account (using market_id from the pool state) to correctly identify the base and quote mints.

Relevant Instruction: Swap (Instruction index 9). The same instruction is used for SwapBaseIn and SwapQuoteIn.

Rust Scaffolding: The existing LiquidityStateV4 in src/dex/raydium.rs is accurate. The key is to add logic to the parser to fetch the associated Serum Market account to correctly orient the token pair.

3. Lifinity
Lifinity uses a unique, proactive concentrated liquidity model.

Official Docs: Lifinity Developer Docs

Technical Deep Dive: Lifinity Protocol Docs

Program ID (v2): EewxydAPCCVuNEyrVN68PuSYdQ7wKn27V9GJEbpNcHcn

Key Accounts:

Pool Account: Main state account.

Token Vaults (A and B): Holds reserves.

LP Mint: Mint for LP tokens.

Authority: PDA owning the vaults.

Relevant Instruction: Swap. The quoting logic is not a simple x*y=k formula and must be implemented according to their official documentation, which combines a constant product formula with an oracle-based rebalancing mechanism.

Rust Scaffolding: The existing LifinityPoolState struct is a placeholder and must be verified against the on-chain data layout.

4. Meteora
Meteora is an aggregation of multiple pool types (legacy, Dynamic AMM, DLMM). The bot must be able to identify and handle each.

Official Docs: Meteora Developer Docs

Reference SDK: Meteora SDKs (TypeScript)

Program IDs:

Dynamic Pools: MERt85kncMvv62gIe9GgAb6y2vR81Ltmvj3rD1wB36H

DLMM: LBUZKhRxPF3XUpBCjp4QCsfMswyq7ARBvckTJGftS9Z

Key Accounts: Varies significantly by pool type. The integration requires a flexible system that can map a program ID to its specific parser and instruction builder. DLMM, for example, is similar to Orca Whirlpools but uses Bin accounts instead of TickArray accounts.

Relevant Instruction: swap. Each pool type has a unique swap instruction layout.

Rust Scaffolding: Requires separate state structs for each pool type (e.g., LbPair for DLMM, another for Dynamic Pools).

5. Phoenix - DEFERRED FOR STRATEGIC REASONS
Phoenix is a fully on-chain order book, not an AMM. After technical feasibility analysis, we've decided to defer Phoenix integration due to:

CRITICAL ISSUE: Solana version conflicts (Phoenix SDK requires 1.18.26, workspace uses 1.18.3)
RISK ASSESSMENT: High probability of breaking existing DEX integrations  
STRATEGIC DECISION: Focus on perfecting 4-DEX powerhouse instead

Technical Details (for future reference):
Official Docs: Phoenix Developer Docs
Reference SDK: Phoenix Rust SDK
Program ID: PhoeNiXZ8ByJGLkxNfZRnkUfjvmuYqLR89jjFHGqdXY
Key Challenge: Dependency management nightmare with current architecture

DECISION: Build the ultimate 4-DEX arbitrage bot with multi-hop routing and parallel processing instead.
Phoenix can be added later when dependency issues are resolved or when natural version upgrades occur.

Rust Scaffolding: Deferred - focus on optimizing existing 4 DEX integrations for maximum performance.

DEX PLAN OF ACTION
1. Start with a Comprehensive Design Document
Document Everything: Write out a high-level design document that explains your project‚Äôs goal, architecture, key modules, and how they interact.

Define Requirements and Scope: Clearly list out requirements, features, and edge cases.

2. Break Down the Project into Manageable Tasks
Modularize the Design: Divide the project into smaller, independent components.

Task Lists & Milestones: Develop a step-by-step roadmap with milestones.

3. Use Iterative Development and Incremental Feedback
Small Iterations: Ask for small, self-contained pieces of code.

Review and Test Each Piece: Test the output immediately.

4. Leverage Additional Development Tools
Version Control & CI: Set up a Git repository and use CI tools.

Linters and Formatters: Integrate clippy and rustfmt.

Automated Testing: Write unit tests for every module.

5. Provide Explicit, Detailed Specifications in Your Prompts
Step-by-Step Instructions: Be as explicit as possible.

Context Sharing: Share your design document summary and goals.

Error Handling and Logging: Ask for detailed logging and comments.

6. Position Yourself as a Project Manager and Code Reviewer
Collaborative Mindset: View AI output as a draft.

Explicit Review: Walk through code line by line.

Feedback Loop: Be prepared to iterate with direct feedback.

METEORA INTEGRATION PROGRESS UPDATE
====================================================================

‚úÖ COMPLETED INTEGRATION (All Tests Passing - 20/20):

1. **Research & Setup**:
   - Confirmed official program IDs:
     - Dynamic AMM: Eo7WjKq67rjJQSZxS6z3YkapzY3eMj6Xy8X5EQVn5UaB
     - DLMM: LBUZKhRxPF3XUpBCjp4YzTKgLccjZhTSDM9YuVaPwxo
   - Found and analyzed Meteora CPI examples repository for instruction structures

2. **State Structures Implementation**:
   - Implemented DynamicAmmPoolState (520 bytes) with complete field layout
   - Implemented DlmmLbPairState (304 bytes) with complete field layout  
   - Both structs are Pod/Zeroable compliant for safe bytemuck parsing
   - Verified field alignment and memory layout consistency

3. **Flexible Parser System**:
   - Built MeteoraPoolParser that detects pool type by program ID and data size
   - Supports both Dynamic AMM and DLMM pool type identification
   - Robust error handling for unknown program IDs and insufficient data

4. **DexClient Implementation**:
   - Implemented MeteoraClient with calculate_onchain_quote() method
   - Uses constant product formula for Dynamic AMM (DLMM would need bin-based pricing)
   - Added swap instruction framework (returns descriptive errors about needed accounts)
   - Proper integration with arbitrage bot's PoolInfo structure

5. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - 20 unit tests covering all functionality:
     - Struct size validation and memory layout
     - Pod compliance and field alignment  
     - Parser logic for both pool types
     - Error handling for edge cases
     - Quote calculation with fee handling
     - Client creation and default implementation
   - All tests passing with verified program IDs

6. **Swap Instruction Framework**:
   - Researched official instruction structures from Meteora CPI examples:
     - Dynamic AMM swap needs: pool, vaults, token_vaults, lp accounts, protocol fees
     - DLMM swap needs: lb_pair, reserves, oracle, bin arrays, event authority
   - Implemented scaffolding that returns descriptive errors about required accounts
   - Ready for full instruction building once pool state parsing is added

üîß **Next Steps for Full Production Ready**:
   - Parse pool state to extract vault/reserve account addresses
   - Implement complete instruction builders for both pool types
   - Add bin array derivation for DLMM swaps
   - Full integration testing with real pool data

**Architecture Achievement**: Successfully created a modular, test-driven Meteora integration that flexibly handles both Dynamic AMM and DLMM pool types. The parser system can identify pool types and route to appropriate handlers, laying the foundation for full swap execution.

**Files Modified**:
- src/dex/meteora.rs (full implementation)
- src/dex/meteora_test.rs (comprehensive test suite)  
- src/dex/mod.rs (module inclusion)

**Test Coverage**: 100% pass rate on 20 comprehensive unit tests
